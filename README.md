# Hotel Booking System - Spring Boot Application

This project is a Hotel Booking System built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, and **JWT** for secure user authentication. It allows users to manage hotel room bookings, user roles (ADMIN and USER), and perform CRUD operations on bookings and users. The system supports JWT-based stateless authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
